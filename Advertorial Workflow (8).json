The vet/doctor is surprised.\n\n11. **Life After [product]**  \n    A comparison to before: peace of mind, health restored, emotional relief, financial savings.\n\n12. **Emotional Close & CTA**  \n    End with a powerful reflection or warning:  \n    *‚ÄúDon‚Äôt wait until it‚Äôs too late.‚Äù*  \n    *‚ÄúI wish I‚Äôd known sooner.‚Äù*  \n    *‚ÄúEvery day you wait increases the risk.‚Äù*\n\n---\n\n### ‚úÖ Writing Requirements:\n\n- Use a **natural, emotionally expressive first-person voice**\n- Include **vivid sensory details**: time of day, sounds, dialogue, internal panic, relief\n- Emphasize **emotions**: guilt, fear, helplessness, love, gratitude, hope\n- Use **conversational storytelling**, not marketing-speak\n- Technical info should come from a vet/doctor as quoted dialogue\n- Final message should be emotionally persuasive, not salesy\n\n### üìù Output Format:\n\n- The output should be one continuous **first-person story ad**, broken into small, digestible paragraphs.\n- Write in a ‚Äúscroll-stopping‚Äù format suitable for Facebook ‚Äî bold lines, emotional punch, easy flow.\n- Target word count: **1,200‚Äì1,**\n\nExample:\n\n",

Anti-Bacterial Coating That Stops Slime Formation</h3>\n                    <p class=\"story-text\">The inside of the Purrify has a special silver-ion coating that kills bacteria on contact. This means the invisible bacterial slime literally cannot form. No other fountain has this coating. They just let bacteria grow and multiply.</p>\n                    \n                    <h3 style=\"font-size: 18px; font-weight: 700; color: #2d5016; margin-bottom: 10px;\">2. Oxygen Infusion System</h3>\n                    <p class=\"story-text\">The Purrify doesn't just move water‚Äîit adds tiny oxygen bubbles that make the water taste like a fresh mountain stream. This triggers your cat's ancient \"safe water\" programming. Regular fountains can't do this. They just push old, stale water in circles.</p>\n                    \n                    <h3 style=\"font-size: 18px; font-weight: 700; color: #2d5016; margin-bottom: 10px;\">3. Bio-Safe Materials</h3>\n                    <p class=\"story-text\">Every part that touches water is made from medical-grade materials that bacteria cannot stick to. Cheap fountains use regular plastic that becomes a bacteria breeding ground within days. When I set up the Purrify in Max's usual spot, the difference was immediate.</p>\n                </div>\n\n                <div class=\"story-quote\">\n                    \"${data.mainQuote}\"\n                </div>\n\n                <!-- Customer Story Continuation -->\n                <div class=\"content-section\">\n                    <p class=\"story-text\">That's exactly what ${data.customerName} said after she discovered the real reason why ${data.targetAudience.toLowerCase()} struggle with this problem - and more importantly, the simple solution that fixes it.</p>\n                </div>\n\n                <!-- Testimonials -->\n                <h2 class=\"section-headline\">${data.testimonialsSectionHeading}</h2>\n                \n                <div class=\"testimonial-card\">\n                    <div class=\"testimonial-text\">\"I was skeptical after trying 2 other fountains that didn't work. My 8-year-old Maine Coon, Oliver, had already been to the emergency vet twice for blockages ($4,200 total). My vet mentioned the Purrify specifically and said it was the only one she recommends because of the special coating. Within 3 days of setting it up, I could hear Oliver drinking throughout the day - something I NEVER heard with the other fountains. It's been 8 months now and zero problems. The peace of mind alone is worth every penny. Don't waste time with cheap pet store fountains like I did.\"</div>\n                    <div class=\"testimonial-author\">- Linda</div>\n                </div>\n\n                <div class=\"testimonial-card\">\n                    <div class=\"testimonial-text\">\"My 16-year-old Siamese, Princess, had been getting more and more lethargic. The vet said her kidney values were 'concerning' and she was probably chronically dehydrated. I bought the Purrify after reading about the oxygen bubbles - figured it was worth a try. The change was dramatic. Within 2 weeks she was more active, her coat got shinier, and she stopped having those awful constipation episodes. Her latest bloodwork showed improved kidney function. My vet was amazed and asked me what fountain I was using because she wanted to recommend it to other clients.\"</div>\n                    <div class=\"testimonial-author\">- Patricia</div>\n                </div>\n\n                <!-- Health Impact Section -->\n                <div class=\"content-section\">\n                    <p class=\"story-text\">But here's what shocked me most...

Anti-Bacterial Coating That Stops Slime Formation</h3>\n                <p class=\"story-text\">The inside of the Purrify has a special silver-ion coating that kills bacteria on contact. This means the invisible bacterial slime literally cannot form. No other fountain has this coating. They just let bacteria grow and multiply.</p>\n                \n                <h3 style=\"font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; margin: 25px 0 15px 0;\">2. Oxygen Infusion System</h3>\n                <p class=\"story-text\">The Purrify doesn't just move water‚Äîit adds tiny oxygen bubbles that make the water taste like a fresh mountain stream. This triggers your cat's ancient \"safe water\" programming. Regular fountains can't do this. They just push old, stale water in circles.</p>\n                \n                <h3 style=\"font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; margin: 25px 0 15px 0;\">3. Bio-Safe Materials</h3>\n                <p class=\"story-text\">Every part that touches water is made from medical-grade materials that bacteria cannot stick to. Cheap fountains use regular plastic that becomes a bacteria breeding ground within days. When I set up the Purrify in Max's usual spot, the difference was immediate.</p>\n                \n                <p class=\"story-text\"><strong>Within 24 hours, Max was sniffing around the fountain curiously.</strong></p>\n            </div>\n\n            <div class=\"image-placeholder\">\n                Cat Drinking from Fountain: 600x400px\n                (Image showing a cat actively drinking from the Purrify fountain)\n            </div>\n\n            <div class=\"testimonial-section\">\n                <div class=\"testimonial-text\">\"I was skeptical after trying 2 other fountains that didn't work. My 8-year-old Maine Coon, Oliver, had already been to the emergency vet twice for blockages ($6,200 total). My vet mentioned the Purrify specifically and said it was the only one she recommends because of the special coating. Within 3 days of setting it up, I could hear Oliver drinking throughout the day - something I NEVER heard with the other fountains. It's been 8 months now and zero problems. The peace of mind alone is worth every penny. Don't waste time with cheap pet store fountains like I did.\"</div>\n                <div class=\"testimonial-author\">Linda</div>\n            </div>\n\n            <div class=\"testimonial-section\">\n                <div class=\"testimonial-text\">\"My 16-year-old Siamese, Princess, had been getting more and more lethargic. The vet said her kidney values were 'concerning' and she was probably chronically dehydrated. I bought the Purrify after reading about the oxygen bubbles - figured it was worth a try. The change was dramatic. Within 2 weeks she was more active, her coat got shinier, and she stopped having those awful constipation episodes. Her latest bloodwork showed improved kidney function. My vet was amazed and asked me what fountain I was using because she wanted to recommend it to other clients.\"</div>\n                <div class=\"testimonial-author\">Patricia</div>\n            </div>\n\n            <div class=\"testimonial-section\">\n                <div class=\"testimonial-text\">\"After spending over $300 on 4 different fountains that my cats ignored, I was ready to give up. But then my friend showed me this article about bacterial slime and how most fountains actually make it worse. That explained everything! The Purrify was more expensive but I figured if it didn't work, at least I'd know I tried everything. Day one - both my cats were curious. Day three - I heard them drinking. Day seven - I was refilling it twice as often because they were drinking so much! It's been 6 months and my water bowl is now just decoration. Both cats only drink from the Purrify.

        "text": "=# ANGLE-DRIVEN ADVERTORIAL CONTENT OPTIMIZATION TASK\n\nYour task is to optimize ONLY the text content within HTML advertorials to match a specific narrative angle while making ZERO changes to HTML structure, CSS, classes, styling, or any design elements.\n\n## CORE MISSION:\n\nTransform generic advertorial content into compelling, angle-specific narratives that feel authentic and drive conversions through strategic storytelling that aligns with the provided angle.\n\n## ANGLE-BASED CONTENT OPTIMIZATION:\n\n### 1. ANGLE ALIGNMENT\n- **Match the Narrative Voice:** Adapt all content to reflect the specific angle's tone, perspective, and emotional approach\n- **Maintain Angle Consistency:** Ensure every piece of text content supports and reinforces the chosen angle\n- **Character Development:** Align character background, motivations, and journey with the angle's target audience\n- **Problem-Solution Mapping:** Frame the pain points and solutions through the lens of the specific angle\n\n### 2. AUTHENTIC STORYTELLING WITHIN ANGLE\n- **Eliminate AI-Generated Language:** Remove robotic phrases while staying true to the angle's voice\n- **Enhance Emotional Resonance:** Build genuine emotional connection that matches the angle's emotional core\n- **Specific Detail Integration:** Add believable specifics that support the angle's narrative framework\n- **Natural Flow Creation:** Ensure content flows naturally while maintaining angle consistency\n\n### 3.

the angle's demographic and tone\n- **Background Alignment:** Ensure character details support the angle's target audience\n- **Journey Authenticity:** Make character transformation believable within the angle's context\n\n## WHAT YOU MUST NEVER CHANGE:\n\n### ABSOLUTE NO-TOUCH ZONES:\n- **HTML Tags:** No adding, removing, or modifying any HTML tags\n- **CSS Classes:** No changing class names or attributes\n- **Styling Elements:** No modifications to any style-related code\n- **Structure Elements:** No changing divs, sections, containers, or layout elements\n- **Links and URLs:** No modifying href attributes or link structure\n- **Image Tags:** No changing img tags, src attributes, or alt text\n- **Form Elements:** No modifying input fields, buttons, or form structure\n- **JavaScript:** No adding or modifying any script elements\n- **Responsive Elements:** No modifying breakpoints or mobile-specific code\n\n## CONTENT AREAS TO OPTIMIZE (TEXT ONLY):\n\n### Primary Content Optimization

AFTER EVERY SENTENCE SKIP ALINE, NO PARAGRAPH LIKE SENTENCES\n10. 9 **BOLDING FOR SCANNABILITY**\nBold these elements:\n- Key statistics and numbers\n- Shocking revelations**\n- Solution benefits and results\n- Urgency/scarcity elements\n- Guarantee terms\n- Call-to-action phrases\n\n##IMPORTANT RULE\n-make sure in the interface I see bolding not \"\"**\"\".\n- I want bolding in BLACK\n\n\nRemember: You are optimizing content to match a specific narrative angle. Every word of text content must serve the angle's story while treating the HTML structure as completely untouchable. Focus on creating compelling, angle-aligned content that converts through authentic storytelling.\n\n\n\n## AGAIN, DO NOT CHANGE THE URLS\n## THIS IS THE ANGLE CONTEXT\n{{ $('AI Agent3').item.json.output }}\n\n##HTML Context\n{{ $json[\"htmlContent\"] }}\n",
